Build the portable Windows folder for Planner.

Produces Planner\ carrying its own Python and every dependency, so the PC it
lands on needs no Python, uv or git - download, unzip, double-click Planner.cmd.
The app opens in your default browser and quits once the last tab closes.

Built for x64, on the machine running this script.

Usage:
  ./windows_install/make_dist.ps1 [-Version 1.0.0] [-NoZip]
#>
param([string]$Version = "1.0.0", [switch]$NoZip)
